Course Deployment Notes
========================

1. Accessing the Application:
   - The Course application has been successfully deployed in the `{{ .Values.namespace }}` namespace.
   - To access the application, use the NodePort:
     ```
     URL: http://<Node_IP>:{{ .Values.service.nodePort }}
     Port: {{ .Values.service.nodePort }}
     ```
   - Ensure that the NodePort is open and accessible from your environment.

2. Configurations:
   - Environment variables have been configured through the ConfigMap and injected into the application.
   - These include configurations for Keycloak, MongoDB, Stripe, PayHere, and other services.

3. Debugging:
   - To check the status of the deployment, use:
     ```
     kubectl get deployments -n {{ .Values.namespace }} course-deployment
     ```
   - To inspect pod logs, use:
     ```
     kubectl logs -n {{ .Values.namespace }} <pod_name>
     ```
   - Replace `<pod_name>` with the name of the running pod.

4. Managing Configurations:
   - Configuration values can be updated by modifying the `values.yaml` file and applying the chart again:
     ```
     helm upgrade <release_name> ./course
     ```

5. Scaling the Application:
   - To scale the application replicas, use:
     ```
     kubectl scale deployment course-deployment --replicas=<number> -n {{ .Values.namespace }}
     ```

6. Helm Chart Details:
   - Release Name: `<release_name>`
   - Namespace: `{{ .Values.namespace }}`

7. Cleanup:
   - To delete the deployment and associated resources, use:
     ```
     helm uninstall <release_name> -n {{ .Values.namespace }}
     ```

Thank you for deploying Course with Helm! If you encounter any issues, ensure that all dependencies like MongoDB and Keycloak are properly configured and reachable.
